# Tiny Language Compiler

See language definition at [http://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/language.htm](http://jlu.myweb.cs.uwindsor.ca/214/language.htm)

This small repo consists of two implementations. [autogenerated](./autogenerated) uses `flex` as lexical parser with rules defined in `tiny.l` and `bison` as grammatical parser with rules defined in `tiny.y`. [handwritten](./handwritten) is purely implemented by hand. 

Both will generate pseudo assembly which can be run by `vm.py`

## How to Run

### Autogenerated

```bash
cd autogenerated && make && cd ..
./autogenerated/tiny < sample.tiny > autogenerated.asm
```

### Handwritten

```bash
cd handwritten && make && cd ..
./handwritten/tiny < sample.tiny > handwritten.asm
```

### Run VM

```bash
python vm.py autogenerated.asm
```

or

```bash
python vm.py handwritten.asm
```
